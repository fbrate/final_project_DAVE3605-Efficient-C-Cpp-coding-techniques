Tic Tac Toe game in terminal. Written in c++.

This game was developed in Debian 9 “Jessie”. And is compiled using the GNU C++ compiler:
g++. It is tested in Windows and Linux environments. It has not been tested on an OS X system but since it is based on UNIX it will most likely run there as well.

For Linux any terminal should do the job.

For Windows I have tested and successfully executed the program using CYGWIN(Cygwin,
2019) and is my recommended (and proved to work, no other Windows terminals are tested)
terminal.
trick:


How to compile:
(Make sure no other source/header files are in the folder).
g++ *.h *.cpp
