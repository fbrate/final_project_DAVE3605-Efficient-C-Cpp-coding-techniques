<h2>Tic Tac Toe game in terminal. Written in C++.</h2>

This game was developed in Debian 9 “Jessie”. And is compiled using the GNU C++ compiler:
g++. It is tested in Windows and Linux environments. It has not been tested on an <i>OS X</i> system but since it is based on UNIX it will most likely run there as well.

For <i>Linux</i> any terminal should do the job.

For <i>Windows</i> I have tested and successfully executed the program using CYGWIN(Cygwin,
2019) and is my recommended (and proved to work, no other Windows terminals are tested)
terminal.

<h3>How to run:</h3>
